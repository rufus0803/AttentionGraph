  Custom flag parser for Tuple objects that is based on the existing parsers
  in `absl.flags`. This parser can be used to read in and override tuple
  arguments. It outputs a `tuple` object from an existing `tuple` or `str`.
  The ony requirement is that the overriding parameter should be a `tuple`
  as well. The overriding parameter can have a different number of elements
  of different type than the original. For a detailed list of what `str`
  arguments are supported for overriding, look at `ast.literal_eval` from the
  Python Standard Library.
